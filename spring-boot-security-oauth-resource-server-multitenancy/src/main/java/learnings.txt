If we don't provide resource server that we are going to use JWT Token or opaque token then we get this error
Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Jwt and Opaque Token are the only supported formats for bearer tokens in
Spring Security and neither was found. Make sure to configure JWT via http.oauth2ResourceServer().jwt() or Opaque Tokens via http.oauth2ResourceServer().opaqueToken().
