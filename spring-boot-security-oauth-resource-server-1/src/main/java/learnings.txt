Is there any need to include spring security dependency when using oauth resource server dependency??
No, since oauth resource server dependency transitively includes the spring security dependency as well.

JWT Token is exposed to the client then how is it safe??
Although JWT is exposed to the client and client can even see the headers and body present in the JWT but since any
given JWT has signature and the resource server(backend) will verify that signature it won't be a security issue.
Any change in headers/body of the JWT will result in the change in the signature and hence while verifying the token it
will easily be seen.

From where we can get the jwks uri??
Jwks uri can be fetched from the openid-configuration public url localhost:8080/.well-known/openid-configuration
In this url you will get jwks uri which will be http://localhost:8080/oauth2/jwks

What does jwks uri even provides us with??
Jwks uri provides us the public parts of the key pair that has been used to sign the jwt token.

Is it safe that Resource server has access to the jwks uri??
Yes it is completely safe since jwks uri is simply exposing the public parts of key pair. Public key can only be used in
validating the token and nothing else.

Why do we have to get public key from the jwks uri, can't we directly configure them in the resource server???
It is generally complicated to configure private part of the key pair in the Auth server and public part in the Resource
server. As during key rotation we will have two places where we will have to make the changes.
Most importantly it breaks the separation of concerns as we will have to handle it at both the places.

Scope vs Authorities
In OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect (OIDC), scope refers to the level of access that the client application is requesting.
Scopes control what clients can do on behalf of the user with external resources or APIs. Scopes like read and write
define the permissions the client application is requesting to interact with the user's data.
A client requests scope=read to retrieve user data from an API (like profile information).
A client requests scope=write to modify or create new data on the API (like updating the user's profile).

Authorities generally refer to a user's permissions or roles in an application or system. These define what a user is
allowed to do within a given context

How Token is getting verified in Resource Server??
It is done by default. Spring converts the JWT Token details inside the Authentication object and put it in the Security
Context. By Default authorities has client scopes and not actual authorities of the user. If we want then we have to
write our own custom JWTTokenConverter that will populate the details from JWT to Authentication object.


oauth2ResourceServer() is exposed to be used in conjunction with HttpSecurity Object and makes an app a resource server.
