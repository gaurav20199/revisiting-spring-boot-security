1) AuthorizationServerSettings Bean can be used to configure/ modify the auth server settings like changing the default
urls and other things
2) redirect_uri can't have localhost as per specification but if we really want to use it in the redirect_url then we
can make a custom validator and allow implementation where localhost can be used.
3) Spring Authorization Server uses NimbusJwtEncoder to encode and sign issued access tokens (In JWT Format)
4) By Default access tokens are signed using an auto generated RSA Key pair stored in memory.

Common Doubt:
When using spring authorization server with authorization code grant type, when we send request to authorize with client
id & redirect uri and scope we get redirected to login page and after login we get redirected to client redirect uri
and get the code but when we try to repeat the flow we will get the authorization code directly without being redirected
to login page and this is because that session id is maintained and for that session user has already authenticated so
user don't have to log-in again
